### Overview ###

The objective of `slidify` is to make it easy to create reproducible HTML5 presentations from `.Rmd` files. 

The guiding philosophy of `slidify` is to completely separate writing of content from its rendering, so that content can be written once in `R Markdown`, and rendered as an `HTML5` presentation using any of the `HTML5` slide frameworks supported.

### Installation ###

This package is not available on `CRAN` as yet. A development version can be installed from `github` using the `devtools` package. 

```{r eval = F}
library(devtools)
install_github('slidify', 'ramnathv')
```

In addition to `slidify`, you would also need to install development versions of `knitr`, `whisker` and `markdown`.

```{r eval = F}
install_github('knitr', 'yihui')
install_github('whisker', 'edwindj')
install_github('markdown', 'rstudio')
```

### Usage ###

`slidify` is designed to make it very easy for a HTML novice to generate a crisp, visually appealing `HTML5` slide deck. You can do it in just three steps!

* Write your [source](slides.Rmd) file in [R Markdown](http://goo.gl/KKdaf)
* Separate your slides using a horizontal rule `---`
* Run `slidify("slides.Rmd")` to generate your [slide deck](slides.html).

# Customizing Your Presentation #

---

### Options ###

`slidify` aims to provide a high degree of customization for the more advanced users. You can access the options currently available by typing `slidifyOptions()` at the command line. The main options are

     framework       : slide generation framework to use
     theme           : theme to use for styling slide content
     transition      : theme to use for slide transitions
     highlighter     : tool to use for syntax highlighting
     histyle         : style to use for syntax highlighting
     copy_libraries  : should library files be copied to slide directory
     lib_path        : path to libraries (framework, highlighter)
     layout          : slide layout to use
     template        : slide template to use
     mathjax         : should mathjax be used
     embed           : should local files be embedded
     
The next few slides provide a more detailed overview of each of these options and what values they can take.

---

### framework ###

`slidify` allows you to render your slides using several HTML5 slide frameworks. Currently supported frameworks are:

* [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/)
* [dzslides](http://paulrouget.com/dzslides/)
* [html5slides](http://html5slides.googlecode.com/)
* [shower](http://pepelsbey.github.com/shower/en.htm)
* [slidy](http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/Overview.html#(1))

Extending `slidify` to accommodate other frameworks is pretty straightforward. The plan is to support more frameworks over time.

---

### theme ###

The `theme` option lets you style your slides. Currently, this option is available only for `deck.js` which allows the following themes

* web-2.0
* swiss
* neon

Themes are just `css` files. So it is easy to extend this option to the other frameworks if you can write css. 

---

### transition ###

The `transition` option allows you to define the transition between slides. Currently, this option is available only for `deck.js` which allows the following transitions

* horizontal-slide [default]
* vertical-slide
* fade

Please consult [deck.js](http://goo.gl/UFthM) documentation for more information on `themes` and `transitions`


---

### highlighter ###

`slidify` is designed to be modular and syntax highlighting is one module. Currently two options are supported

* `highlight.js` 
* `highlight`

The `highlight.js` option does client side highlighting using the javascript library [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/), while the `highlight` option generates a static page, highlighted using the R package [highlight](http://goo.gl/uy8Ww). 

You will notice that the quality of highlighting for `R` code is better when done with the `R` package, rather than `highlight.js`. 

It would be straightforward to add other `javascript` based syntax highlighters like `google.prettify`, `shJS` etc.


---

### histyle ###

`slidify` allows you complete control over how you want to style your source code using `css`. The styles currently supported depend on the `highlighter` chosen.

* `highlight.js` :  see its [documentation](http://goo.gl/uEJj). 
* `highlight` : type `knit_theme[['get']]()` to see available styles


In order to use the `R` option, you need to include the line `opts_knit$set(out.format = 'html')` inside your `.Rmd` file. This is required to fool `knitr` into highlighting source code. Specifying it outside the document does not work as `knitr` resets it to `md` as soon as it sees the `.Rmd` extension.

---

### mathjax ###

Setting `mathjax` to true allows you to write math in your presentations. `slidify` automatically adds a link to the required `js` files from Mathjax CDN. 

$$latex
\begin{aligned}
\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{B}} -\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t} & = \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}} \\   \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{E}} & = 4 \pi \rho \\
\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{E}}\, +\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} & = \vec{\mathbf{0}} \\
\nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{B}} & = 0 \end{aligned}
$$

A cross-product formula, again from the Mathjax website

$$latex
\mathbf{V}_1 \times \mathbf{V}_2 =  \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
\frac{\partial X}{\partial u} &  \frac{\partial Y}{\partial u} & 0 \\
\frac{\partial X}{\partial v} &  \frac{\partial Y}{\partial v} & 0
\end{vmatrix}
$$

--- build

### Animated Lists ###

It is easy to animate a list by adding the class specified `build`. For example, consider the `markdown` source below

    * Point 1
    * Point 2
    * Point 3

It produces the slide

* Point 1
* Point 2
* Point 3
    
---

### Issues ###

Different `HTML5` slide generation frameworks style the same elements differently. Moreover, they use different classes to define incremental builds, full page assets/media etc.

As a result, a slide deck that looks visually appealing in one framework, may not look as nice in another. It will require carefully overriding the `css` definitions across frameworks so as to reach some kind of consistency.

The long-term goal of `slidify` is to be able to truly stand by the "write once, style as you like" idea.
